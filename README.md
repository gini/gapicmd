## Supported platforms

## Security

gapicmd can operate with builtin default credentials to give you a smooth start. This convinience function could have a possible downside for you.
In theory another user could access your documents if he/she knew your user-id. This is unlikly but it's important for you to understand the possible
risks.

If you don't set a user ID (--user-id) gapicmd will generate a random string everytime you run gapicmd. Here's how a autogenerated user-id
looks: ```xZhXUpvh5-46gYLU=6pEZj-1RdF9kwg3K2kB7V.-s8N3RDPp4K28-FdOffSmDNK6```.

If you want to be on the safe side get [in contact](mailto:hello-partners@gini.net) to get your personal Gini client credentials.

Documents uploaded by the shared user-id are removed automatically after a couple of days.
