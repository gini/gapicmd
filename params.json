This convinience function could have a possible downside for you.\r\nIn theory another user could access your documents if he/she knew your user-id. This is unlikly but it's important for you to understand the possible\r\nrisks.\r\n\r\nIf you don't set a user ID (--user-id) gapicmd will generate a random string everytime you run gapicmd. Here's how a autogenerated user-id\r\nlooks: ```xZhXUpvh5-46gYLU=6pEZj-1RdF9kwg3K2kB7V.-s8N3RDPp4K28-FdOffSmDNK6```.\r\n\r\nIf you want to be on the safe side get [in contact](mailto:hello-partners@gini.net) to get your personal Gini client credentials.\r\n\r\nDocuments uploaded by the shared user-id are removed automatically after a couple of days.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe MIT License (MIT)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2015 Gini GmbH\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\r\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
